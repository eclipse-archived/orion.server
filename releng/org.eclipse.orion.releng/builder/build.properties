############## BUILD NAMING CONTROL ################
# The directory into which the build elements are fetched and where
# the build takes place.
buildDirectory=${base}/${buildLabel}

# Type of build.  Used in naming the build output.  Typically this value is
# one of I, N, M, S, ...
buildType=I

# ID of the build.  Used in naming the build output.
buildId=${timestamp}

# Label for the build.  Used in naming the build output
buildLabel=${buildType}${buildId}

#The value to be used for the qualifier of a plugin or feature when you want to override the value computed by pde.
#The value will only be applied to plugin or features indicating build.properties, qualifier = context 
#forceContextQualifier=<the value for the qualifier>

#Enable / disable the generation of a suffix for the features that use .qualifier. 
#The generated suffix is computed according to the content of the feature   
#generateFeatureVersionSuffix=true

############# BASE CONTROL #############
# Settings for the base Eclipse components and Java class libraries 
# against which you are building.
# Base location for anything the build needs to compile against.  For example,
# in most RCP app or a plug-in,  the baseLocation should be the location of a previously
# installed Eclipse against which the application or plug-in code will be compiled and the RCP delta pack.

base=${builder}/../build

fetchCacheLocation=${base}/gitClones

#Folder containing repositories whose content is needed to compile against
repoBaseLocation=${base}/target/repoBase
#Folder where the content of the repositories from ${repoBaseLocation} will be made available as a form suitable to be compiled against
transformedRepoLocation=${base}/target/transformedRepos

#this property indicates whether you want the set of plug-ins and features to be considered during the build to be limited to the ones reachable from the features / plugins being built
filteredDependencyCheck=false

#this property indicates whether the resolution should be done in development mode (i.e. ignore multiple bundles with singletons)
resolution.devMode=false

#pluginPath is a list of locations in which to find plugins and features.  This list is separated by the platform file separator (; or :)
#a location is one of:  
#- the location of the jar or folder that is the plugin or feature : /path/to/foo.jar or /path/to/foo
#- a directory that contains a /plugins or /features subdirectory
#- the location of a feature.xml, or for 2.1 style plugins, the plugin.xml or fragment.xml

############# MAP FILE CONTROL ################
# This section defines CVS tags to use when fetching the map files from the repository.
# If you want to fetch the map file from repository / location, change the getMapFiles target in the customTargets.xml
